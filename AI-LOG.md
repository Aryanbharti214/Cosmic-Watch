AI-LOG.md
Project: Cosmic Watch – Interstellar Asteroid Tracker & Risk Analyser
Purpose of This Document

This log documents how Large Language Models (LLMs) were used strictly as an assistance tool during development.
All architectural decisions, core logic, and final implementations were designed, written, and validated by the team.

AI tools were used to accelerate understanding, debugging, and documentation, not to replace original development work.

AI Tools Used

ChatGPT (OpenAI)

How AI Was Used (Permitted Assistance)
1. Conceptual Guidance

AI was used to:

Clarify problem requirements from the hackathon statement

Understand high-level system architecture options

Discuss best practices for full-stack application structure

Brainstorm feature prioritization under hackathon time constraints

All final architectural choices were made by the team.

2. Debugging & Error Resolution

AI assisted in:

Interpreting runtime errors and stack traces

Explaining configuration issues (e.g., Vite, CORS, environment variables)

Suggesting debugging steps for frontend–backend integration

The team manually applied fixes and verified them locally.

3. API Documentation Assistance

AI was used to:

Understand how Swagger/OpenAPI documentation works

Learn how to integrate Swagger with a Node.js backend

Draft initial documentation templates, which were then edited and customized by the team to reflect the actual API behavior

4. UI/UX Improvement Suggestions

AI provided:

Suggestions for improving UI layout and visual hierarchy

Recommendations for professional dashboard patterns

Guidance on loading states, empty states, and visual feedback

All UI components were manually implemented and styled by the team.

5. Language & Documentation Refinement

AI helped:

Improve clarity and professionalism of README files

Refine Postman request descriptions

Improve grammar and technical clarity in documentation

All submitted code reflects team understanding and ownership.

Verification of Original Work

All code was written during the hackathon timeframe

Development occurred locally using standard tooling (Node.js, React, Docker, Git)

Version control history reflects incremental, meaningful commits

Final system behavior was tested and validated by the team

Declaration

We affirm that:

AI tools were used only as assistants

The project is original work

The team understands and can explain all submitted code and design decisions

This log is provided in good faith to ensure transparency and compliance with hackathon rules.
